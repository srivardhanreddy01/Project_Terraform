# Project_Terraform

This project is based on the template provided by [write_your_first_terraform_project](https://github.com/iam-veeramalla/write_your_first_terraform_project/).

## Local State Management

In the initial phase of this project, we focused on establishing local state management for our Terraform infrastructure. Local state management involves keeping the state information of our infrastructure within the local environment. In this phase, we achieved the following:

- **Terraform Script**: We created a Terraform script to manage the state information locally. This script facilitates the provisioning of an EC2 instance within your local environment.

- **EC2 Instance Creation**: The Terraform script deploys an Amazon EC2 instance as part of our infrastructure.

- **Information Retrieval**: We can easily retrieve information about the created EC2 instance using the `terraform show` command.

## Remote State Management

Recognizing the importance of safe and collaborative state management, we transitioned to a more robust approach known as remote state management. In this phase, we addressed the following considerations:

- **AWS S3 Remote Backend**: We implemented a remote backend using Amazon S3 to securely store our Terraform state. Storing the state remotely enhances reliability and data integrity, making it an essential practice for Terraform projects.

- **DynamoDB Locking**: To prevent conflicts and ensure smooth collaboration among multiple users, we integrated our remote backend with Amazon DynamoDB for state locking. This ensures that only one user can apply changes to the infrastructure at any given time, reducing the risk of concurrent modifications.

- **Output.tf for Information**: To conveniently access essential information about our infrastructure, we have included an `output.tf` file. This file prints all necessary data once the `terraform apply` command is executed. It provides details about the created S3 bucket and DynamoDB table, making it easier to work with these resources.

- **Variables.tf for Uniqueness**: We use a `variables.tf` file to define variables, including a unique name for the S3 bucket and DynamoDB table. This ensures that each instance of our infrastructure has a distinct identifier, preventing naming conflicts.

By following these best practices in local and remote state management, our Terraform project is well-prepared for scalability, reliability, and collaboration in a multi-user environment. For more details, please refer to the provided template and project documentation.
